# YouTopia Search Benchmark

Welcome to the **YouTopia Search Benchmark**! This project evaluates the performance of YouTopia Search against leading AI search platforms, specifically **Perplexity Pro**.

## Overview

Our system, **YouTopia Search**, is designed to provide high-quality, readable, and comprehensive answers by leveraging advanced search capabilities. This benchmark aims to demonstrate our system's competitive performance in key areas of search evaluation. We've conducted a series of tests to compare how YouTopia Search and Perplexity Pro handle a standard question set, with results evaluated by two different state-of-the-art AI models: Claude-4-sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Pro.

## Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation is based on a predetermined benchmark **question set**. The performance metrics are an average of the results from this set. We focused on two main criteria:

- **Answer Quality**: This measures the accuracy and reproducibility of the information provided in the answer.
  
- **Readability, Structure, and Comprehensiveness**: This metric evaluates how easy the answer is to read, whether it's well-organized, and if it covers the topic thoroughly.
  

The evaluations were conducted with a human-in-the-loop approach, using AI models to score the results.

- The **Claude-4-sonnet** model was used to evaluate answer quality. You can view the reproducible evaluation link [here](https://claude.ai/share/649517a8-46f1-4859-9e3e-86357cb3042e "null").
  
- The **Gemini-2.5-Pro** model was used to evaluate readability, structure, and comprehensiveness. The reproducible evaluation link is [here](https://g.co/gemini/share/d0d6d2f44ad9 "null").
  

## Results

The following table summarizes the average scores of YouTopia Search and Perplexity Pro across the benchmark questions:

| **What We Measured** | **YouTopia Search** | **Perplexity PRO** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Answer Quality (reproducible results, evaluated by Claude-4-sonnet) | **8.5/10** | 8.9/10 |
| Readability, structure and comprehensiveness (reproducible results, evaluated by Gemini-2.5-Pro) | **10/10** | 8.3/10 |

As shown in the table, YouTopia Search achieved a perfect score in readability, structure, and comprehensiveness, demonstrating a superior ability to present information clearly and effectively. Our answer quality also remains highly competitive, demonstrating performance comparable to Perplexity Pro.
